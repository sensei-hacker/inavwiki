# Important Notes

> The GPS NMEA protocol is no longer supported. All pilots are required to switch to UBLOX protocol. All modern GPS modules (even as old as from 2015 and earlier) support UBLOX protocol and there is not a single good reason to stick to NMEA nowadays

> The FrSky D-series telemetry support has been removed. This applies to legacy D4R receivers and some 3rd party whoop boards

# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 6 and 6.1

1. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 7](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
1. Upgrade to INAV 7 using the **Full Erase** option in the configurator.
1. In case of Analog FPV, upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
1. Go to the CLI again and paste the above-described contents from the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
1. There are many new, changed, and removed settings. Check carefully that the settings are correct and fix any unrecognized or out-of-range items from the saved configuration.
1. You should be ready, explore new 7.0 features, and enjoy!

## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

# Major changes

## Flexible motor and servo output allocation

INAV now was a function that allows to flexibly assign functions to PWM outputs directly from INAV Configurator.
Specific function `AUTO`, `MOTORS` or `SERVOS` can be assigned to each Timer Group. Then, all outputs from this group will perform this function.
Thanks to this, it's possible to use servos and motors in ways that previously required building a custom targets.

Bear in mind:
* In some rare cases, output assignment migh be different than in INAV 6
* It is not possible to assign function to individual outputs. It's a hardware, not software limitation. 

## Mixer profiles and VTOL support

## Ez Tune

## Timer DMA Burst

INAV 7 adds the DMA Burst mode to selected target as ultimately fixes the problem of DSHOT protocol not working on some boards. Pilots do not have to take any actions, DSHOT is just available on previously affected flight controllers. This applies to:

* Matek F405 TE
* SpeedyBee F405 V3

## JETI EXBUS fixed

The JETI EXBUS protocol should now not hang the flight controller during operation. The issue was originally fixed in https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/13130 . Thank you @SteveCEvans and @klutvott123

## Multirotor Cruise Mode

## NMEA Protocol no longer available

As mentioned in the `Important Notes` section, INAV 7 no longer supports the GPS NMEA protocol. All modern GPS module support one of the UBLOX protocols and as a result pilots must switch to either `UBLOX` or `UBLOX7` protocol. 

## GPS Improvements

![INAV GPS Improvements](https://quadmeup.com/assets/inav/inav_gps_improvements.png)

## MSP VTX support

### Other changes

* The `AUTOLEVEL` mode is renamed to `AUTO LEVEL TRIM`

### Other removed functions

* FrSky D-series telemetry
* `output_mode` setting that allows to reassign all PWM outputs to either MOTORS or SERVOS

# New targets

* SDmodel H7V1
* Matek H743HD
* SpeedyBee F405 V4
* SpeedeBee F405 Mini
* SpeedyBee F2 Mini V2
* GEPRCF405
* GEPRCF722
* NEUTRONRC F435 Mini AIO
