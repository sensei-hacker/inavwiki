# Important Notes

> The GPS NMEA protocol is no longer supported. All pilots are required to switch to UBLOX protocol. All modern GPS modules (even as old as from 2015 and earlier) support UBLOX protocol and there is not a single good reason to stick to NMEA nowadays

> The FrSky D-series telemetry support has been removed. This applies to legacy D4R receivers and some 3rd party whoop boards

> Make sure to remove props and check your motor and servo outputs before powering your upgraded flight controller with a battery for the first time. The changes to enable flexible motor and servo allocation may change what outputs your configuration uses by default.

# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 6 and 6.1

1. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 7](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
1. Upgrade to INAV 7 using the **Full Erase** option in the configurator.
1. In case of Analog FPV, upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
1. Go to the CLI again and paste the above-described contents from the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
1. There are many new, changed, and removed settings. Check carefully that the settings are correct and fix any unrecognized or out-of-range items from the saved configuration.
1. You should be ready, explore new 7.0 features, and enjoy!

## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

# Major changes

## Flexible motor and servo output allocation

INAV now was a function that allows to flexibly assign functions to PWM outputs directly from INAV Configurator.
Specific function `AUTO`, `MOTORS` or `SERVOS` can be assigned to each Timer Group. Then, all outputs from this group will perform this function.
Thanks to this, it's possible to use servos and motors in ways that previously required building a custom targets.

![INAV output assignment](https://quadmeup.com/assets/inav/inav_output_assignment.png)

Bear in mind:
* In some rare cases, output assignment might be different than in INAV 6. **This make is even more important to remove your props and double check your outputs before you power you flight controller with batteries for the first time after applying your old settings or enabling outputs.**
* It is not possible to assign function to individual outputs. It's a hardware, not software limitation.

## Mixer profiles and VTOL support

This has been a frequent request since PNP VTOL models started becoming more common.

Read more in [INAV docs](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/MixerProfile.md)

## Ez Tune

![INAV Ez Tune](https://quadmeup.com/assets/inav/inav_ez_tune.png)

## Timer DMA Burst

INAV 7 adds the DMA Burst mode to selected target as ultimately fixes the problem of DSHOT protocol not working on some boards. Pilots do not have to take any actions, DSHOT is just available on previously affected flight controllers. This applies to:

* Matek F405 TE
* SpeedyBee F405 V3

## JETI EXBUS fixed

The JETI EXBUS protocol should now not hang the flight controller during operation. The issue was originally fixed in https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/13130 . Thank you @SteveCEvans and @klutvott123

## Multirotor Cruise Mode

The Cruise Mode for Multirotors allows pilots to let go the radio sticks while UAV flies on a predefined course with predefined speed. Just like with  regular PosHold, Throttle stick sets the altitude and course, while the pitch stick is used to set the horizontal speed. When released INAV will hold set speed, altitude, and course. More information available in here https://youtu.be/4pgDxexuSnU

## NMEA Protocol no longer available

As mentioned in the `Important Notes` section, INAV 7 no longer supports the GPS NMEA protocol. All modern GPS module support one of the UBLOX protocols and as a result pilots must switch to either `UBLOX` or `UBLOX7` protocol.

## GPS Improvements

A number of improvements have been made to GPS support in INAV 7.

It is now possible to select multiple GPS constellations, and not only Galileo. If your GPS modules does not support a particular combination, it will fallback to no extra constellations.

M10 GPS units will now default to 10Hz, like M8 units and a new cli setting has been added to allow overriding the update rate of your `UBLOX7` GPS (`gps_ublox_nav_hz`). This should allow you to fall back to 5Hz or bump it up to the limits of what is supported by your GPS module. 

![INAV GPS Improvements](https://quadmeup.com/assets/inav/inav_gps_improvements.png)

## MSP VTX support

INAV now support MSP VTX when using MSP DisplayPort OSD.

Now it is possible to change VTX power levels and channels via INAV's OSD menu or ELRS backpack without connecting the SmartAudio wire on HD-Zero VTXs.

If you MSP DisplayPort OSD is working, no extra configuration is needed.

## Linear Descent RTH mode changed

`AT_LEAST_LINEAR_DESCENT` is no longer a method for RTH. It has been replaced with a more flexible linear descent option that will work with any RTH method. If previously using `AT_LEAST_LINEAR_DESCENT`, you should now just use `AT_LEAST` as the RTH type. Linear Descent is now a separate option that can be used with any other RTH method. To make this possible, the target altitude of the descent is now the `nav_rth_home_altitude`. In some cases, if flying below the home position, this will work as a linear ascent.

You can also decide when the linear descent will start. Set the `nav_rth_linear_descent_start_distance` parameter to the distance (metres) from the home point, where you want to start descending. Set to `0`, the default setting; the descent will start immediately, as with the pre-7.0 implementation.

These options are available in Configurator.

See the [Navigation Mode: Return to Home wiki](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Navigation-Mode:-Return-to-Home#linear-descent) for more details.

## Pilot Logos

You can now have custom pilot logos on your OSD and arming screen (HD Only). You will need to create a custom font with your logos to show them on screen. The OSD logo is a 3x1 character symbol. This can be used with both analogue and HD. The arming screen logo is a 10x4 character image, and only works with HD systems.

More details are available in the [OSD Document](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/OSD.md#pilot-logos).

# Other changes

* The `AUTOLEVEL` mode is renamed to `AUTO LEVEL TRIM`. The functionality remains the same.
* The `osd_mah_used_precision` parameter has been renamed `osd_mah_precision`.
* 24 channels available for Jeti systems (not available with F411 or F722 flight controllers).
* Virtual pitot is enabled by default.

# Other removed functions

* FrSky D-series telemetry
* `output_mode` setting that allows to reassign all PWM outputs to either MOTORS or SERVOS

# New targets

* SDmodel H7V1
* Matek H743HD
* SpeedyBee F405 V4
* SpeedeBee F405 Mini
* SpeedyBee F7 Mini V2
* GEPRCF405
* GEPRCF722
* NEUTRONRC F435 Mini AIO
