# Introduction

This tab lets you change the angle that you FC and compass are mounted on your aircraft. This is critical to setting up INAV. You may have mounted the FC upside-down or backwards and this is where you can save this new orientation. When you go back to the Setup Tab, you should see the 3D Graphic move the same as your actual aircraft.
