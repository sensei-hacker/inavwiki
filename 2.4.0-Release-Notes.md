## Important Notes

## Upgrading from 2.3.0

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 2.4 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Find on your _diff all_ result the `min_throttle` line, and replace it by `throttle_idle`, setting the percentage of the idle throttle. The default is 15.
5. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously create and write _save_ , press ENTER and done!
6. You should be ready, explore new 2.4 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.2.0 or older version

0. Please follow the upgrade guide to 2.3.0 from 2.2.0 [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/2.3.0-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-220) and then step to the previous section.
 
## New targets:

* [Matek F722-PX](https://inavflight.com/shop/s/bg/1625181)
* [Holybro Kakute F7 HDV](https://inavflight.com/shop/s/bg/1541453)

## CLI:

### New commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `msc`   | Enter USB Mass storage mode. See `docs/USB_Mass_Storage_(MSC)_mode.md` for usage information. |

### New settings

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `throttle_idle` | Previously `min_throttle` - Set the idle throttle percent. The percentage of the throttle range (`max_throttle` - `min_command`) above `min_command` used for minimum / idle throttle. Note that the default of 15% will most likely be too high for modern *shot ESCs. |
| `nav_rth_home_offset_distance` | Distance offset from GPS established home to "safe" position used for RTH (cm, 0 disables) |
| `nav_rth_home_offset_direction` |  Direction offset from GPS established home to "safe" position used for RTH (degrees, 0=N, 90=E, 180=S, 270=W, requires non-zero offset distance) |

### Removed settings

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `min_throttle` | Replaced by `throttle_idle` |
| `nav_mc_pos_z_i` | removed |
| `nav_mc_pos_z_d` | removed |

## New drivers and protocols

* BMP388 barometer
* ICM20601 IMU
* SBUS Fast

## RPM Filters

INAV can now take determine where to place notch filters based on the rotation speed of the motors to attenuate noise being fed into PID. 
You need to connect BlHeli telemetry on a serial port and then enable RPM Filters.

## USB Mass Storage 

USB MSC (mass storage device class) SD card and internal flash access is enabled for F4 and F7 targets with suitable hardware. This means you can mount the FC (SD card / internal flash) as a host computer file system via USB to read BB logs (and delete them from an SD card). See `docs/USB_Mass_Storage_(MSC)_mode.md` for usage information.

## RTH Home Offset

Allows INAV RTH and failsafe RTH to not return the launch point but in a nearby area allowing not to violate a protected space which might be active in some flying fields. It's configurable via `nav_rth_home_offset_distance`  which sets the distance offset from GPS established home to "safe" position used for RTH and `nav_rth_home_offset_direction` which configure the direction offset from GPS established home to "safe" position used for RTH (degrees, 0=N, 90=E, 180=S, 270=W, requires non-zero offset distance) 

## Linear Climb and Dive on Waypoint Missions

When flying a mission with different altitude waypoints, the old behaviour was INAV trying to reach the next waypoint altitude as soon as it can, constrained only by `nav_auto_climb_rate`, `nav_fw_climb_angle` and `nav_fw_dive_angle` CLI variables. Aircraft would use a lot of energy to reach the waypoint altitude, and then will keep that altitude for the rest of the way to the waypoint.

Now, INAV will try to climb or dive to the next waypoint altitude in a linearly manner, so it'll reach the next waypoint altitude only when it's almost reaching the waypoint itself. This way aircraft will consume less energy to climb since it'll be a less steep climb or will save energy by trading altitude for speed for more time when diving.

It works for all airframe types, fixed wing or multirotor.

## OSD improvements
Motors RPM can now displayed as a new item. There are minor bug fixes in the FrSky OSD driver.
Furthermore when you navigate the CMS (OSD menu) servos on your airplane will not move anymore.

## Support for DJI HD FPV

INAV is now ready to embrace HD FPV with support for the [DJI HD FPV](https://inavflight.com/shop/s/bg/1540481) system. Just connect the DJI HD VTX to a spare UART, set that UART to have a DJI FPV function in the Configurator Ports tab and you're good to go.

If you want to use DJI remote controller as well, you can connect the S.Bus wire from DJI VTX to your FC as well and select "SBUS Fast" protocol (earlier known as  DJI HDL). INAV fully supports this protocol and will allow you to get 7ms contol latency (as advertised by DJI).
