## Important Notes

## Upgrading from 2.3.0

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 2.4 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Find on your _diff all_ result the `min_throttle` line, and replace it by `throttle_idle`, setting the percentage of the idle throttle. The default is 15.
5. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously create and write _save_ , press ENTER and done!
6. You should be ready, explore new 2.4 features and enjoy!

## New targets:

## CLI:

### New

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `msc`   | Enter USB Mass storage mode. See `docs/USB_Mass_Storage_(MSC)_mode.md` for usage information. |

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| throttle_idle | Previously `min_throttle` - Set the idle throttle percent. The percentage of the throttle range (`max_throttle` - `min_command`) above `min_command` used for minimum / idle throttle. |

### Removed

## USB Mass Storage 

USB MSC (mass storage device class) SD card and internal flash access is enabled for F4 and F7 targets with suitable hardware. This means you can mount the FC (SD card / internal flash) as a host computer file system via USB to read BB logs (and delete them from an SD card). See `docs/USB_Mass_Storage_(MSC)_mode.md` for usage information.
