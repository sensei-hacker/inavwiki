2. Upgrade to INAV 2.5 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.

5. You should be ready, explore new 2.5 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.3 or older version

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.
 
## New targets:

* 

## CLI:

### New commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
|         |             |

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `motor_direction_inverted` | Boolean ON / OFF, replaces `yaw_motor_direction` |

### Removed settings

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `yaw_motor_direction` | replaced by `motor_direction_inverted` |

## New drivers and protocols

* BME280 Barometer ([@gereic])

## Initial Rover and Boat support ([@DzikuVx])

Starting from version 2.5, INAV supports Rovers and Boats (more general: ground and water vehicles without altitude control with yaw steering only. Remark: tanks and vehicles with differential steering are also supported). 

The Rover and Boat related features:
* Flight modes: PosHold, AltHold, Cruise, Launch, Loiter Direction Change, Angle, Horizon, FPV Angle Mix, Turn Assist, Airmode are not available on Rover and Boat platforms
* Feature 3D is renamed to Reversible Motors
* Reversible ESCs are now working correctly
* New Heading PID controller used for YAW control on rovers and boats
* Return To Home is working. Rover will disarm at the end of RTH procedure. Bear in mind, it will return in a straight line, no Smart RTH support yet.
* Waypoint Missions are operational. Rover will drive directly int the direction of the Waypoint. At the last Waypoint, it will stop motors instead of loitering.  

## Reversible ESCs support ([@DzikuVx])

Description

## New Matrix Filters for Multirotors ([@DzikuVx])

The new Matrix Notch filter comes enabled by default on INAV. It's a dynamic notch filter that detects noise frequencies on each individual axis (X, Y and Z) and apply the filters to each axis, resulting in a much better noise handling.

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0QsVIXYWCE) to see a detailed explanation of how the Matrix Filter works.

## JUMP, HOLD and LAND Waypoint types ([@giacomo892], [@Jacky2k], [@stronnag])

INAV 2.5 supports additional waypoint types, allowing more complex missions to be performed.

* **JUMP**: Defines a 'jump' to another waypoint, allowing mission loops (backward jump) and forward jumps. The number of jump iterations is also user defined.
* **POSHOLD_TIME**: Defines the amount of time for which the aircraft will loiter at the waypoint position before proceeding to the next waypoint.
* **LAND**: Defines a location for landing. This allows INAV to perform one-way missions.

The [navigation messages wiki page](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-Navigation-Messages) provides more information and annotated examples.

## HUD POI Waypoints markers ([@OlivierC-FR])
Shows the next waypoints in the hud. To enable this feature, enter the count of next waypoints in the CLI command:

`set osd_hud_wp_disp = 0 to 3`

Or on the CMS menu: OSD > HUD > Displayed items > Next waypoints: (from 0 to 3, 0 means disabled)

Then start a WP mission, the next WPs will appear as soon as the mission is loaded in FC memory AND that the aircraft has a valid GPS heading, so it must move if it's not fitted with a magnetometer.

## Legacy Targets

Due to flash / memory restrictions the following functions have been disabled on F3 targets:

* Pitot
* Multirotor braking
