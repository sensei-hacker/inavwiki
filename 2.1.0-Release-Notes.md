## Important Notes

1. INAV 2.1 is the last release of INAV that fully supports **F3** and especially **Omnibus F3** boards. Due to the lack of flash and RAM, future versions of INAV will either remove functions on F3 or not support those boards at all. STM32F3 are strongly discouraged for new builds and existing builds should be upgraded to F7 boards
2. Feature **AIRMODE** is enabled by default on all targets! There is no need to change that on _Fixed Wings_ at all. On _Multirotors_, if there a need to do so, users might disable it and enable _AIRMODE_ as a flight mode on a switch like before. In the majority of the cases, _AIRMODE_ can be enabled on _Multirotors_ all the time. The two cases when a user might make it conditional are: usage of MOTOR_STOP or disabling for landing.
3. ASYNC processing is gone. Gyro/Acc updates now happens in sync with the control loop.
4. **DSHOT** is one of the new features of INAV 2.1. A digital protocol, like what DSHOT is, can substain a certain amount of noise with no performance degradation and allows a very smooth motor output. This comes at the cost of not offering a way in between a perfectly working setup or a not working one! (Think for instance to you Digital Television!).
DSHOT requires a very clean setup and short ESC signal wires run. You might find your DSHOT setup perfectly working on the bench and failing when flying. If you are unsure about your setup just stick with analog protocols like ONESHOT or MULTISHOT. More on the topic can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVkBNhii9sw)

## Upgrading from 2.0.0

1. Be sure to run the latest INAV 2.1 Configuration release. Download from [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
2. Go to the CLI tab and copy and paste the `diff` output to a text file for later usage. 
3. Flash INAV 2.1.0 enabling **full chip erase** . Now you FC should run INAV 2.1.0 Connect again and check the firmware version.
4. Go to CLI tab and paste all the contents you previously saved into a text file and press enter. Wait for it to finish. Type `save` and you should be good to go!
12. Enjoy INAV 2.1.0 and explore its new features!

## Upgrading from 1.9.X

1. Be sure to run the latest INAV 2.1 Configuration release. Download from [here]
2. Go to the CLI tab and copy and paste the `diff` output to a text file for later usage. 
3. Go to the OSD tab and take a screenshot of the current layout
4. Flash INAV 2.1.0 enabling **full chip erase** . Now you FC should run INAV 2.0. Connect again and check the firmware version.
5. Go to the Mixer tab and load and apply your desired mixer.
6. Go back to your configuration text file and delete all lines starting with: mixer acczero accgain magzero osd. Adjust values to be adjusted noted in the release notes.
7. Open the CLI tab in the configurator and paste your cleaned up configuration in the text box and type `save` and press enter. The flight controller will now reboot.
8. Calibrate the accelerometer following the steps in the dedicated tab. Only first two steps need to be made in the right order.
9. Calibration of the magnetometer should be done at the field. The magnetic field indoors can be distorted and led to a bad calibration.
10. Restore manually your OSD layout using the screenshot and upload the font you like using the dedicated button.
11. Carefully check all the configuration and check on the bench without installed propellers if everything looks good. In particular, check if the model preview behaves correctly when you are moving your model and check surfaces movements for an airplane.
12. Enjoy INAV 2.1.0 and explore its new features!

## CLI:

### New

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `rc_filter_frequency` | RC data biquad filter cutoff frequency. Lower cutoff frequencies result in smoother response at expense of command control delay. Practical values are 20-50. Set to zero to disable entirely and use unsmoothed RC stick values |
|`fw_iterm_limit_stick_position` |Iterm is not allowed to grow when stick position is above threshold. This solves the problem of bounceback or followthrough when full stick deflection is applied on poorely tuned fixed wings. In other words, stabilization is partialy disabled when pilot is actively controlling the aircraft and active when sticks are not touched. 0 mean stick is in center position, 1 means it is fully deflected to either side |
| `nav_mc_braking_speed_threshold` | min speed in cm/s above which braking can happen |
| `nav_mc_braking_disengage_speed` | braking is disabled when speed goes below this value |
| `nav_mc_braking_timeout` | timeout in ms for braking |
| `nav_mc_braking_boost_factor` | acceleration factor for BOOST phase |
| `nav_mc_braking_boost_timeout` |how long in ms BOOST phase can happen |
| `nav_mc_braking_boost_speed_threshold` | BOOST can be enabled when speed is above this value|
| `nav_mc_braking_boost_disengage_speed` | BOOST will be disabled when speed goes below this value |
| `nav_mc_braking_bank_angle` | max angle that MR is allowed to bank in BOOST mode |
| `osd_artificial_horizon_max_pitch` | Max pitch, in degrees, for OSD artificial horizon |
| `osd_failsafe_switch_layout` | If enabled the OSD automatically switches to the first layout during failsafe |

### Removed

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `acc_task_frequency` | |
| `attitude_task_frequency` | |
| `async_mode` | |
| `smix reverse` | input reverse can be done on the mixer level |

## Main changes

### DSHOT

INAV 2.1 supports DSHOT ESC protocol. It can be configured using `motor_pwm_protocol` CLI setting. The following versions of DSHOT are supported:

* DSHOT150
* DSHOT300
* DSHOT600
* DSHOT1200

There is no DSHOT telemetry or DSHOT commands support yet!

Be advised that DSHOT is not well tested on INAV and because of being digital protocol can totally fail on setups with high electrical noise without giving any sign of degradation or motor stuttering. 

DSHOT is enabled on following targets:
* ASGARD32F4
* ASGARD32F7
* COLIBRI_RACE
* FIREWORKSV2
* FOXEERF405
* FOXEERF722DUAL
* MATEKF405 (CTR, STD, not WING)
* MATEKF722
* MATEKF722SE
* OMNIBUSF4
* OMNIBUSF7NXT
* REVO

### Multirotor braking mode

#### Requirements and setup

1. Multirotor has to be capable of running 3D Position Hold: GPS, Compass, and Baro are required
1. `MC BRAKING` flight mode has to be enabled
1. UAV has to be put into User Control Mode ***CRUISE***

![01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/966811/45925090-1c005a80-bf0f-11e8-85a1-fce9537ee3b8.PNG)

![02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/966811/45925091-1dca1e00-bf0f-11e8-8f20-416eb603107b.PNG)

#### Settings

* `nav_mc_braking_speed_threshold` - min speed in cm/s above which braking can happen
* `nav_mc_braking_disengage_speed` - braking is disabled when speed goes below this value
* `nav_mc_braking_timeout` - timeout in ms for braking
* `nav_mc_braking_boost_factor` - acceleration factor for `BOOST` phase
* `nav_mc_braking_boost_timeout` - how long in ms `BOOST` phase can happen
* `nav_mc_braking_boost_speed_threshold` - `BOOST` can be enabled when speed is above this value
* `nav_mc_braking_boost_disengage_speed` - `BOOST` will be disabled when speed goes below this value
* `nav_mc_braking_bank_angle` - max angle that MR is allowed to bank in BOOST mode

#### How it works:

1. There are two phases `BRAKE` and `BOOST`
1. `BRAKE` can be started then `MC BRAKING` mode is enabled, MR is in `CRUISE` mode, `3D PosHold` is enabled, MR is traveling above `nav_mc_braking_speed_threshold` and pilot releases sticks
1. INAV will store new PosHold position only when copter will stop, not when stricks are released
1. On top of that, `BOOST` phase can be enabled if MR is traveling above `nav_mc_braking_boost_speed_threshold`
1. in `BOOST` phase, MR is allowed to use higher acceleration and banking angle than normal. 
1. Because `BOOSTS` is limited in time, banking angle much higher than default should be fine

#### Tuning

Default values should be pretty safe to use. My 6" machine using following values:

```
set nav_mc_braking_speed_threshold = 100
set nav_mc_braking_disengage_speed = 50
set nav_mc_braking_timeout = 2000
set nav_mc_braking_boost_factor = 150
set nav_mc_braking_boost_timeout = 1000
set nav_mc_braking_boost_speed_threshold = 120
set nav_mc_braking_boost_disengage_speed = 75
set nav_mc_braking_bank_angle = 40
```
