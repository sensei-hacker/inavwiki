Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade INAV Configurator available at [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inav-configurator/fmaidjmgkdkpafmbnmigkpdnpdhopgel). You can also use [Configurator built as a native MacOS or Windows application](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.8.0).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/) and [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/).

## Known bugs


## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Old name               | New name(s)                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `old_setting` | `new_setting`                                      |
| `feature RX_*` | RX type definition as been moved from a `FEATURE` to a setting `receiver_type`, with values of `NONE`, `PWM`, `PPM`, `SERIAL`, `MSP`, `SPI`. |
| - | `totally_new_setting`                                      |
| `tz_offset` | Time zone offset from UTC, in minutes. This is applied to the GPS time for logging and time-stamping of Blackbox logs |
| `failsafe_min_distance` | If failsafe happens when craft is closer than this distance in centimetres from home, failsafe will not execute regular failsafe_procedure, but will execute procedure specified in failsafe_min_distance_procedure instead. 0 = Normal failsafe_procedure always taken. |
| `failsafe_min_distance_procedure` | The failsafe procedure to initiate in Stage 2 when craft is closer to home than failsafe_min_distance. with values of `SET-THR`, `DROP`, `RTH`, `NONE`. See the Failsafe documentation. |

## New boards

* [Board](https://link.com)
* Omnibus F4 Pro Corner
* DYS F4 Pro
* Matek F405 OSD. This requires slightly different firmware to the (also supported) Matek F405 AIO. Please see the board documentation.

## Discontinued boards

- CC3D
- NAZE (all revisions)

## New features

* SmartAudio and Trump VTX support. Band, channel and transmitter power can be changed from CMS
* RC channels naming simplification. `AUX 1` renamed to `CH 5`, `AUX 2` to `CH 6` and so on. This means that restoring old `map` settings from the CLI will not work, for example TAER1234 is now TAER5678. The Configurator handles this transparently.
* `current_meter_offset` can be negative
* Automated navigation modes (RTH and WP) are overriding MOTOR_STOP. Regardless of user throttle stick position motors would always be running
* GPS time is handled by the FC, with the option of a user-defined time-zone correction (either statically from configuration, or dynamically applied via MSP from ground station software)
* Blackbox logs are automatically stamped with creation time from GPS data where available

## OSD related featured and fixes

OSD includes numerous updates, fixes as well as improvements and has received quite significant work for this update, so we're dedicating a whole section in the release notes to it.

Users **must to update the OSD font from the configurator** after upgrading to 1.8. Failing to do so will result in incorrectly displayed indicators, since a lot of new symbols have been added (a clear symptom will be blank spaces in the OSD where a decimal separator should appear).

### General improvements and fixes

* Improved OSD refresh rate.
* Significantly reduced memory and CPU usage by the OSD subsystem.
* Made all OSD numeric fields fixed width.
* Fix all OSD indicator previews look exactly the same in the configurator and in the actual OSD. This allows easily configuring all OSD indicators in a way they don't overlap.
* Added support for hardware based blinking. Makes all elements blink in sync.
* Screen is correctly cleared after exiting CMS and after hiding the stats shown after disarming.
* Enabling GPS will draw the GPS indicators even if the GPS hardware hasn't been detected. This allows configuring GPS related fields in the OSD even if the GPS module is not powered on.
* Improve artificial horizon drawing performance and fix flashing home direction arrow in its default position due to overlapping with the area cleared (but not actually used) by the indicator.

### New indicators

* Combined "On time" / "Fly time" indicator shows "On time" while the aircraft is unarmed and "Fly time" while it's armed. This indicator is now on by default and the old separated indicators are disabled (can still be enabled in the configurator in the OSD tab).
* System messages indicator. Shows messages from several topics, including: additional flight mode information (AUTOTUNE and AUTORIM modes) reasons for not being able to arm, failsafe status when failsafe mode is active and navigation stages when the navigation system is controlling the aircraft.
* Average cell voltage shows the average voltage of each cell rather than the voltage of the whole battery.
* Time of the day indicator shows the current time. Use the new `tz_config` CLI variable to set your current timezone. It will show UTC time otherwise.
* Throttle / Automatic Throttle indicator shows the stick throttle position when the user is directly controlling the throttle while showing the actual throttle value sent to the motors while the navigation system is controlling the throttle output.
* Heading graph indicator shows the heading using a moving graph with the cardinal points rather than heading degrees.
* VTX channel displays the VTX current band and channel. Requires a VTX with SmartAudio or Tramp support.
* Efficiency indicator displays the current map drawn per travelled km. Requires a current sensor.

* Artificial horizon roll direction can now be reversed. This is an experimental feature not available in the configurator and must be enabled using the `osd_artificial_horizon_reverse_roll` CLI variable. Feedback regarding this feature is highly appreciated.
* Artificial horizon crosshairs now has two different styles: the default crosshair or an aircraft symbol. This is an experimental feature not available in the configurator and must be configured using the `osd_crosshairs_style` CLI variable. Feedback regarding this feature is highly appreciated.
* Artificial horizon sidebars now support scrolling. Each bar can be made to scroll depending on variations on either ground speed, altitude or distance to home. Also, optional arrows can be enabled on top/bottom of the sidebar while it's scrolling. This is an experimental feature not available in the configurator and must be enabled using the `osd_left_sidebar_scroll`, `osd_right_sidebar_scroll` and `osd_sidebar_scroll_arrows` CLI variables. Feedback regarding this feature is highly appreciated.

### Alarms

* Added home distance alarm. Makes the home distance indicator blink over a certain distance.
* Negative altitude alarm. Makes the altitude indicator blink when negative altitude becomes greater than a certain value. Useful when taking off from elevated places (like the top of a mountain).

### New statatistics

* Show current time and GPS home position in the armed screen (if available). Allows easily organising DVR recordings and matching them with BlackBox logs.
* Total fly time added to stats screen.
* Reason for disarming added to the stats screen. Can help diagnose hardware failures or other problems that might cause the aircraft to disarm automatically during a flight.


## Bugs fixed

- Fixed blinking in OSD indicators.
- Fixed ghosting of OSD indicators when moving them around in the configurator. The video was showing at the same time the new element at the new position while not erasing it from its old position.
