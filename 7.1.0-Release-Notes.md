# Important Notes

> INAV 7 is the last INAV official release available for F411 based flight controllers. The next milestone, INAV 8 will not be available for F411 boards.

> The GPS NMEA protocol is no longer supported. All pilots are required to switch to UBLOX protocol. All modern GPS modules (even as old as from 2015 and earlier) support UBLOX protocol and there is not a single good reason to stick to NMEA nowadays

> Make sure to remove props and check your motor and servo outputs before powering your upgraded flight controller with a battery for the first time. The changes to enable flexible motor and servo allocation may change what outputs your configuration uses by default.

# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 7.0

1. Backup configuration with CLI `diff all` command
2. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 7.1](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
3. Flash INAV 7.1 **WITHOUT** _Full Chip Erase_ option
4. Done

## Upgrading from INAV 6 and 6.1

1. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 7](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
1. Upgrade to INAV 7 using the **Full Erase** option in the configurator.
1. In case of Analog FPV, upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
1. Go to the CLI again and paste the above-described contents from the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
1. There are many new, changed, and removed settings. Check carefully that the settings are correct and fix any unrecognized or out-of-range items from the saved configuration.
1. You should be ready, explore new 7.0 features, and enjoy!

## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

# Major changes

## Fixed wing Autoland with landing pattern
INAV supports advanced automatic landings for fixed wing aircraft from version 7.1. The procedure is based on landings for man-carrying aircraft, so that safe landings at a specific location are possible. Supported are landings at Safehome after "Return to Home" or at a defined LAND waypoint for missions.
See: [Fixed Wing Landing.md](https://github.com/Scavanger/inav/blob/73be51b3159a0f2df047f094f7d54ac0ed14f7d0/docs/Fixed%20Wing%20Landing.md)


## Altitude and Heading estimation changes
INAV now relies more heavily on GNSS data for navigation than before. This can provide more security if the Barometer fails, or if the multirotor is suffering from Compass interference. By still allowing it to navigate back to home.
For more details see [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/GPS-and-Compass-setup#inav-71-changes)

# Other changes

## Updated ICM426xx filtering
The filtering of the ICM426xx gyros has been updated based on changes made to both Ardupilot and BetaFlight and we expect better performance, when comparing to previous INAV versions.

## Custom OSD 
Users can now customize their own OSD messages, by way of the Programming Framework. [Details](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/OSD-custom-messages)

## New Fixedwing flight mode
The mode is called **Angle Hold**. For more details see [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Modes#angle-hold-fw)

# New targets
