# MultiWii NAV Protocol and Types

This document describes a number of values and enumerations for for **MultiWii** MSP messages. As **iNav** implements a part of this specification it is documented in the iNav wiki.

This information is provided in the hope it might be useful NO WARRANTY.

Note that all binary values are little endian (MSP standard).

# Implementation and versions

This document should match the iNav 1.2 (and later) and Multiwii 2.4 flight controller firmware. The messages described are implemented in mwp (Linux / FreeBSD) and ezgui (Android) ground station applications. mwp and ezgui support both iNav and Multiwii; WinGui is a Windows / Multiwii only mission planner that also supports this message set.

# WayPoint / Action Attributes

Each  waypoint has a type and takes a number of parameters, as below. These are used in the MSP_WP message. The final column indicated if the message is implemented for iNav 1.2 (and later).

| Value | Enum | P1 | P2 | P3 | Lat | Lon | Alt | iNav |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | WAYPOINT      | speed [1] | | | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| 2 | POSHOLD_UNLIM |          | | | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | [5] |
| 3 | POSHOLD TIME  | Seconds | | | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |    |
| 4 | RTH [4]       | Land | | |    |    | ✔ [2] | ✔ |
| 5 | SET POI       |          | | | ✔ | ✔ | | |
| 6 | JUMP          | WP#      | Repeat (-1 = forever) | | | | |  |
| 7 | SET HEAD [3]  | Heading  | | | | | | |
| 8 | LAND | | | | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | |

1. Leg speed is an iNav extension (for multi-rotors only).
2. Not used by iNav
3. Once SET_HEAD is invoked, it remains active until cleared by a P1 value of -1.
4. If a mission contains multiple RTH stanzas, then for MultiWii, the mission terminates at the first RTH. For iNav, the mission will continue if LAND is not set, and valid waypoints follow.
5. If the final entry in a mission is a WP, the iNav treats it as POSHOLD_UNLIM.

## Uploading

For safety, if no mission is defined, a single RTH action should be sent.

| Enum | P1 | P2 | P3 | Lat | Lon | Alt | Flag |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| RTH | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 25m [1] | 0xa5 |

1. your choice, really.

In general, flag is 0, unless it's the last point in a mission, in which case it is set to 0xa5. When waypoints are uploaded, the values are also returned by the FC, thus enabling the application to verify that the mission has been uploaded correctly.

## FC Capabilities (MW only)

Note that 32bit flight controllers (baseflight, cleanflight) use capability == 16 for a different purpose
(CAP_CHANNEL_FORWARDING). It is advised to use other messages for checking for capabilities on non-MW platforms.

| Capability | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| BIND | 1 |
| DYNBAL | 4 |
| FLAP | 8 |
| NAV | 16 |

# Messages (Nav related)

| MNEMONIC | Value | Direction (relative to FC) |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| MSP_NAV_STATUS | 121 | Out |
| MSP_NAV_CONFIG | 122 | Out |
| MSP_WP | 118  | Out |
| MSP_RADIO | 199 | Out |
| MSP_SET_NAV_CONFIG | 215 | In |
| MSP_SET_HEAD | 211 | In |
| MSP_SET_WP | 209 | In (& out) |

# MSP_WP / MSP_SET_WP

Special waypoints are 0 and 255. 0 is the RTH (Home) position, 255 is the POSHOLD position (lat, lon, alt).

| Name | Type | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| wp_no | uchar | way point number |
| action | uchar | action (wp type / action) |
| lat | int32 | decimal degrees latitude * 10,000,000 |
| lon | int32 | decimal degrees longitude * 10,000,000 |
| altitude | int32 | altitude (metre) * 100 |
| p1 | int16 | varies according to action |
| p2 | int16 | varies according to action |
| p3 | int16 | varies according to action |
| flag | uchar | 0xa5 = last, otherwise set to 0 |

The values for the various parameters are given in the section “WayPoint / Action Attributes”
Note that altitude is measured from the "home" location, not absolute above mean sea level.

# MSP_NAV_STATUS

The following data are returned by a MSP_NAV_STATUS message. The texts are those defined by Wingui; multiwii and iNav support this message. Almost the same data is returned by the [iNav LTM NFRAME](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Lightweight-Telemetry-(LTM)#navigation-frame-n)

# MSP_RADIO

If you have a 3DR radio with the MW/MSP specific firmware, the follow data are sent from the radio, unsolicited.

| Name | Type | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |

# Implementations

The MSP NAV message set is implemented by mwptools (Linux), ezgui (Android) and WinGUI (MS Windows).

# XML Mission Files

mwptools, ezgui (and WinGUI) share an XML mission file format. A [reverse engineered definition (XSD)](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/blob/master/samples/mw-mission.xsd) can be found in the mwp samples  directory.
