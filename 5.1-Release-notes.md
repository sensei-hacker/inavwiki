# Important Notes

## Config wipe mitigation

INAV 5.1 lowers the probablity of a full config wipe on reboot. Bear in mind, technically it's not a bug. When FC is disconnected during EEPROM write, checksum will not updated and INAV will erase flash on next boot as a safety measure. To prevent this from happening, always wait until INAV fully reboots before disconnecting the flight controller.

## Mamba H743 and ZEEZF7 V2 external flash

INAV 5.1 supports 128Mbit W25N01G flash memory that can be found on Mamba H743 and ZEEZF7 V2.

## Horizon Drift mitigation

To improve AHI drift on fixed wings, apply following settings via CLI:

### For airplanes without a tail (wings, delta, etc)
```
set imu_acc_ignore_rate = 9
set imu_acc_ignore_slope = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_p = 35
set nav_fw_pos_z_i = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_d = 10
set nav_fw_pos_xy_p = 70
set imu_dcm_kp = 1000
set imu_dcm_ki = 0
```

### For airplanes with a tail (dedicated elevator)
```
set imu_acc_ignore_rate = 7
set imu_acc_ignore_slope = 4
set nav_fw_pos_z_p = 25
set nav_fw_pos_z_i = 5
set nav_fw_pos_z_d = 7
set nav_fw_pos_xy_p = 55
set imu_dcm_kp = 1000
set imu_dcm_ki = 0
```

# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 5

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 5.1 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go to the CLI again and paste the above-described contents from the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
6. You should be ready, explore new 5.1 features, and enjoy!

## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.
