## Important Notes

### F3 Removal

STM32 F3 flight controllers like Omnibus F3 or SP Racing F3 are no longer supported in INAV. If you are still using F3 boards, please migrate to F4 or F7.

The supporting code will be retained for a few more releases, but will not be maintained and is not guaranteed to build or work properly in the future.

### Adjustments
There are now separate adjustments for D and CD/FF gains. This breaks compatibility with `diff`s from previous releases. Check the adjustments tab in the configurator after restoring a `diff` to makes sure they are set up correctly.

### Font update required
The OSD fonts have been improved (@Jettrel) and there are several new symbols. Therefore, a font file update is required. Load the updated font of your choosing from the OSD tab.

## Upgrading from 2.6, 2.6.1

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 3.0 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
5. There are a large number of new, changed and removed settings. Check carefully that the settings are correct and fix any unrecognised or out of range items from the saved configuration.
6. You should be ready, explore new 3.0 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.5 or older version

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

## New targets:

* Diatone MambaF405US_I2C
* FLYWOOF411_V2
* Mamba F722_I2C

## CLI:

### New commands

None (TBC).

### Changed Settings

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| blackbox_device | Default: target |
| log_level | Default: ERROR |
| nav_overrides_motor_stop | When set to OFF the navigation system will not take over the control of the motor if the throttle is low (motor will stop). When set to OFF_ALWAYS the navigation system will not take over the control of the motor if the throttle was low even when failsafe is triggered. When set to AUTO_ONLY the navigation system will only take over the control of the throttle in autonomous navigation modes (NAV WP and NAV RTH). When set to ALL_NAV (default) the navigation system will take over the control of the motor completely and never allow the motor to stop even when the throttle is low. This setting only has an effect on NAV modes which take control of the throttle when combined with MOTOR_STOP and is likely to cause a stall if fw_min_throttle_down_pitch isn't set correctly or the pitch estimation is wrong for fixed wing models when not set to ALL_NAV |
| nav_rth_climb_first | New: `ON_FW_SPIRAL` |
| platform_type | Default: MULTIROTOR |
| receiver_type | Default: target |
| rssi_source | Default: AUTO |

### New Settings

| Setting | Description |

| fw_yaw_iterm_freeze_bank_angle | Yaw Iterm is frozen when bank angle is above this threshold [degrees]. This solves the problem of the rudder counteracting turns by partially disabling yaw stabilization when making banked turns. Setting to 0 (the default) disables this feature.

| gyro_use_dyn_lpf | Use Dynamic LPF instead of static gyro stage1 LPF. Dynamic Gyro LPF updates gyro LPF based on the throttle position. Default: FALSE |
| imu2_align_pitch | Pitch alignment for Secondary IMU. 1/10 of a degree Values: -1800 - 3600 Default: 0 |

RTH altitude is reset to the current altitude using pitch down stick. RTH CLIMB FIRST is overridden using right roll stick so craft turns and heads directly to home (CLIMB FIRST override only works for fixed wing) Default: FALSE |

## New drivers and protocols

* Rangefinder "GY-US42(v2) Ultrasonic Range Sensor
* Rangefinder vl53l1x
* BNO055 Secondary IMU
* BMI088 IMU

## New features

### Turtle mode aka Flip Over after crash ([@kernel-machine])

inav now has a "Turtle Mode".

* Requires DSHOT ESC protocol
* Assign a switch to TURTLE mode
* Ensure you can arm at any angle

### WP mission sealevel altitude datum  ([@breadoven])

Prior to inav 3.0, mission waypoint altitudes are relative the arming location. It is now possible to define waypoints with absolute (AMSL) altitude, making the mission independent of the arming location. See the [inav wiki](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-Navigation-Messages#waypoint-and-action-attributes) for details (WP `paramater 3`)

### WP Mission Landing Elevation Setting ([@breadoven])

The relative / absolute ground altitude of a `LAND` waypoint may be set as WP `paramater 2` (m). See the [inav wiki](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-Navigation-Messages#waypoint-and-action-attributes) for details.

### Do not slow down in WP mission when approaching a waypoint ([@DzikuVx])

### DShot Beeper  ([@harry1453])

### RC via MAVLink & MAVLink V2 Support ([@harry1453])

### Prearm Mode ([@harry1453])

Prearm offers a two-stage arming process as an optional additional safety feature.

* Activate prearm (normally a button or momentary switch)
* Activate arm

### Initial cut on H7 MCU support ([@digitalentity], [@bkleiner], [@DzikuVx])

H7 is available in the source repository; target Hex files will be released as targets mature, probably in the future point releases.

### Add D-term to control loop on fixed wing aircraft ([@avsaase])

## Improvements and updates

### Gyro processing improvements ([@DzikuVx])

### Update EGNOS PRN mask to latest EGSA definition, fix SBAS for non-Galileo usage ([@stronnag])

The EGNOS (GPS ground assistance)  definitions have been updated to the latest values for all GNSS options. An invalid association with availability of Galileo has been corrected.

### Make CW270FLIP default MAG alignment ([@DzikuVx])

New FCs raraly feature on-board compass, and most GPS+MAG default to CW270FLIP, so this is now the inav default. If you use another value, check your setup after upgrading.

### Add CRUISE mode which is equivalent to CRSH+AH ([@shellixyz])

### Add option to display min cell voltage instead of min pack voltage on the disarm screen ([@avsaase])

### Bump OSD font min version to 2 ([@shellixyz])

Users must upgrade OSD Fonts to Version 2 (or later).

### Multirotors: add new setting for final landing vertical speed instead of being hard-coded to 25% of set landing vertical speed ([@shellixyz])

### Drop gyro_sync ([@DzikuVx])

### Delayed safehome ([@tonyyng])

Safehome does not now replace the arming location until it is needed. If you cancel RTH or recover from RX failsafe, the original arming location is restored as the home location. Under normal circumstances, "distance to home" will revert to range from the arming location.

### Switched RTH Preset Altitude Override ([@breadoven])

Provides stick options to override configured RTH climb and/or turn behaviour. See the `nav_rth_alt_control_override` setting description for details.	

### Renamed OSD SW and LEDLOW to OSD/LEDS OFF ([@MrD-RC])

### Fixed wing RTH Spiral Climb Option ([@breadoven])

### Increase loiter max radius to 300m ([@DzikuVx])

### Rename NAV CRUISE mode to NAV COURSE HOLD ([@shellixyz])

### Homogenize OSD AHI settings prefix ([@shellixyz])

### Do not slow down in WP mission when approaching a waypoint ([@DzikuVx])

### Configure speed source for DJI OSD  ([@DzikuVx])

### Pan servo home direction offset  ([@avsaase])

### Increased fw loiter radius default ([@MrD-RC])

### Ability to trim pitch angle for level flight ([@DzikuVx])

### vtx_smartaudio_early_akk_workaround option ([@RomanLut])

### Added option to output servos on PWM and SBUS ([@IVData])

### build: Use -Os for F7 targets with flash <= 512K ([@fiam])

### Option for local plus codes on osd ([@avsaase])
This adds the option to remove the first 2, 4, or 6 digits from the OSD plus code. Doing so requires a reference location (for example your current location when using Google Maps on your phone) within ~600, ~40, and ~2km, respectively.

### Changed default settings for fixed wing throttle smoothing in navigation modes ([@Airwide])
Throttle smoothing in the navigation modes on fixed wing aircraft is now enabled by default. This results in smoother throttle management and more efficient cruising.

### Disable all F3 targets  ([@DzikuVx])

### FrSky Pixel OSD: Honor ahi_max_pitch when drawing the horizon line ([@fiam], [@shellixyz])
