## WARNINGS

* If you are using HMC5883/HMC5983 compass it is advised to recalibrate. Please don't restore the old settings from the dump/diff script.

## Known bugs
* todo

## Renamed `PASSTHROUGH` flight mode (fixed wing)

The `PASSTHROUGH` flight mode has been renamed to `MANUAL`. New settings also have been added to allow the use of different servo rates (or control weight) for the servos when flying without stabilization without using a programmable remote control. The exponential settings for roll/pitch and yaw controls are now also also independent from the exponential settings used for stabilized flight modes. See the `manual_*` settings in the CLI settings table below. The default settings make the `MANUAL` flight mode behave exactly as the old `PASSTHROUGH` flight mode.

## Increased VBAT resolution

The battery voltage resolution has been increased from 100mV to 10mV. In consequence the `vbat_scale`, `vbat_max_cell_voltage`, `vbat_warning_cell_voltage` and `vbat_min_cell_voltage` settings resolution has also been increased 10 fold allowing more precise battery voltage calibration and battery voltage thresholds. To restore old configuration settings users need to multiply their old setting values by 10.

New defaults for these settings:
* `vbat_scale`: 1100 (was 110)
* `vbat_max_cell_voltage`: 424 (was 43) or 4.24V/cell
* `vbat_warning_cell_voltage`: 350 (was 35) or 3.5V/cell
* `vbat_min_cell_voltage`: 330 (was 33) or 3.3V/cell

Users who were using the old defaults should not use the settings from their `dump` but use the new defaults instead.

Users now have the option to display 1 or 2 decimals for battery voltages in the OSD display (see `osd_main_voltage_decimals` in the CLI settings table below).

## Battery capacity monitoring

It is now possible to display the remaining battery capacity in the OSD and also use the battery capacity thresholds (`battery_capacity_warning` and `battery_capacity_critical`) for battery alarms.

For the capacity monitoring to work you need a current sensor (`CURRENT_METER` feature). For monitoring energy in milliWatt hour you also need voltage measurement (`VBAT` feature). For best results the current and voltage readings have to be calibrated.

For the remaining battery capacity to be displayed users need to set the `battery_capacity` setting (>0) and the battery to be full when plugged in. If the `battery_capacity` setting is set to 0 the remaining battery capacity item in the OSD will display `NA` and the battery gauge will use an estimation based on the battery voltage (like it used to be) otherwise it will display the remaining battery capacity down to the `battery_capacity_critical` setting (battery considered empty). For the capacity thresholds to be used for alarms the `battery_capacity_warning` and `battery_capacity_critical` settings also needs to be set (>0) and the battery to be full the moment it is plugged in. The value are absolute meaning that `battery_capacity_warning` is the battery capacity left when the battery is entering the `warning` state and `battery_capacity_critical` is the battery capacity left when the battery is considered empty and entering the `critical` state. 

For the battery to be considered full the mean cell voltage of the battery needs to be above `vbat_max_cell_voltage - 140mV` (by default 4.1V). So a 3S battery will be considered full above 12.3V and a 4S battery above 16.24V. If the battery plugged in is not considered full the remaining battery capacity OSD item will show `NF` (Not Full).

For the remaining battery capacity and battery gauge to be the most precise (linear relative to throttle from full to empty) when using battery capacity monitoring users should use the milliWatt hour unit for the battery capacity settings. The battery capacity settings unit can be set using the `battery_capacity_unit` setting (see the CLI parameters table below).

## NAV Launch (airplane launch assistant) available as feature

The mode can now be permanently enabled via the configurator or the CLI using `feature FW_LAUNCH` in this case `NAV LAUNCH` doesn't need to be enabled via a transmitter switch prior to arming freeing a switch for other uses. If you inadvertently disarm mid-air, `NAV LAUNCH` will be active again after arming again so, before raising the throttle again (you should lower the throttle to arm again) move pitch/roll stick and you will have full control back. If you have this feature enabled and for some reason you want to launch the plane manually just move pitch/roll stick right after arming and you have back full control for a manual launch.

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:
