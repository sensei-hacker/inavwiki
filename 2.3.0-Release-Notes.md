## Important Notes

## Upgrading from 2.2.0

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 2.3 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously create and write _save_ , press ENTER and done!
5. You should be ready, explore new 2.3 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.1.0

0. Please follow the upgrade guide to 2.2.0 and then step to the previous section.
 
## New targets:

## CLI:

### New

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| dyn_notch_width_percent | Distance in % of the attenuated frequency for double dynamic filter notched. When set to `0` single dynamic notch filter is used |
| dyn_notch_range   |  Dynamic gyro filter range. Possible values `LOW` `MEDIUM` `HIGH`. `MEDIUM` should work best for 5-6" multirotors. `LOW` should work best with 7" and bigger. `HIGH` should work with everything below 4" |
| dyn_notch_q       | Q factor for dynamic notches |
| dyn_notch_min_hz  | Minimum frequency for dynamic notches. Default value of `150` works best with 5" multirors. Should be lowered with increased size of propellers. Values around `100` work fine on 7" drones. 10" can go down to `60` - `70` | 
| throttle_scale | Throttle scaling factor. `1` means no throttle scaling. `0.5` means throttle scaled down by 50% |
| vbat_meter_type   | Vbat voltage source. Possible values: `NONE`, `ADC`, `ESC`. `ESC` required ESC telemetry enebled and running |
| antigravity_gain  | Max Antigravity gain. `1` means Antigravity is disabled, `2` means Iterm is allowed to double during rapid throttle movements |
| antigravity_accelerator | |
| antigravity_cutoff_lpf_hz | Antigravity cutoff frequenct for Throtte filter. Antigravity is based on the difference between actual and filtered throttle input. The bigger is the difference, the bigger Antigravity gain |
| sim_pin   | PIN for GSM card module |

## ESC Telemetry

**ESC Telemetry** is a feature of DSHOT ESCs to send some data back to the flight controller - voltage, current, temperature, motor RPM. It required additional wire from an ESC to the flight controller. To configure you need DSHOT as a motor protocol and "ESC output/telemetry" function enabled for the serial port where ESC telemetry wires are connected.

## Dynamic Filters

**Dynamic Filters** is a port of Betaflight dynamic filtering. It uses FFT analysis of gyro traces to locate noise peaks and double notch filters to attenuate them. By default, there are 6 notches, 2 per each axis: roll, pitch and yaw.

To enable **Dynamic Filters**, go to CLI and type 
`feature DYNAMIC_FILTERS`

The default values are suited for 5" mini quads. Depending on the size of multirotor propellers, some adjustments might be required.

| Propeller size	| `dyn_notch_range`   |`dyn_notch_min_hz` |
|----   |----   |----   |
| Below 5"  | `HIGH`    | `200` or more  |
| 5"  | `HIGH` or `MEDIUM`   | `150` or more  |
| 7"  | `LOW`    | `100` or less  |


## Global Functions

_Global Functions_ (abbr. GF) are a mechanism allowing to override certain flight parameters (during flight). Global Functions are activated by Logic Conditions. 

Currently implemented Global Functions

| Name                          | Notes                                 |
|----                           |----                                   |
| OVERRIDE_ARMING_SAFETY        | Allows to arm on any angle even without GPS fix              |
| OVERRIDE_THROTTLE_SCALE       | Override throttle scale to the defined value |
| SWAP_ROLL_YAW                 | basically, when activated, yaw stick will control roll and roll stick will control yaw. Required for tail-sitters VTOL during vertical-horizonral transition when body frame changes |
| SET_VTX_POWER_LEVEL           | Sets VTX power level. Allows to change VTX power level based on distance, switch or other values present in Logic Conditions |
| INVERT_ROLL                   | Inverts ROLL axis input for PID/PIFF controller |
| INVERT_PITCH                  | Inverts PITCH axis input for PID/PIFF controller  |
| INVERT_YAW                    | Inverts YAW axis input for PID/PIFF controller |
| OVERRIDE_THROTTLE             | Override throttle value that is fed to the motors by mixer. Allows for throttle hold |

For details refer to `Global Functions.md` in `docs` folder.

## Pixel based OSD
INAV now supports pixel based OSDs and includes a driver for FrSky's OSD. Some elements, like the artificial horizon, the home arrow or the heading graph include pixel based implementations.

To enable it go to the Ports tab in the configurator and select "FrSky OSD" from the peripherals column of the port that the OSD is connected to. Font uploading and OSD element configuration works in the same way, regardless of the OSD type.

## Development Environment

The iNav `Makefile` will attempt to install a recommended compiler for your platform. Should you wish to override this, or your platform is not supported, please refer to the document `docs/development/Generic_Linux_development.md` which describes how to use an alternative compiler.
