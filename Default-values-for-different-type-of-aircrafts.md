**This is outdated, INAV 1.6 is out and is using PRESET. Values here are old and variable names have changed by adding "mc" and "fw" to differentiate between multicopter and fixed wing.**

Values written here must be based on 1.2 or later!

This is not a replacement for tuning your PIDs, this is only a starting point from you to tune from. There are various tutorials on the internet on how to tune your PIDs.

Worth reading regards to deciding to use asynchronous mode. https://quadmeup.com/inav-how-to-setup-asynchronous-gyro/

### History: **PLEASE WRITE HERE IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING AND WHY.**
```
05.01.3017 ole√∏st: Changed some settings in 250 class.
21.11.2016 oleoat: Removed disabling of baro because fixed in iNav 1.4
21.11.2016 oleoat: Changed recommend gyro_lpf on flying wing, should probably be changed on acrobatic airplanes aswell
17.11.2016 oleost: Added disabled baro for fixedwing until [543](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/pull/543) is fixed
17.11.2016 oleost: Added values for fixed wing.
03.10.2016 artekw: Added default settings for F450
01.10.2016 oleost: Removed old PIDs based on pre 1.2
10.07.2016 oleost: Added disabling mag on flying wing aswell
24.06.2016 oleost: Created first version of this wiki
24.06.2016 oleost: Changed default to "mag_hardware = 1" on regular regular airplane because airplanes flies better with gps heading instead of mag heading.
24.06.2016 oleost: removed looptime 1000, to low for f1 targets.
2016-11-21 stronnag Added Quad 250 settings for F3/ iNav 1.4
2016-11-21 stronnag Added Tri 600 settings for F3/ iNav 1.4
```

# Change to default iNav settings 

Changes **you** think that should be done to iNav globally:

```
24.06.2016 oleost: Change default to velned on because it generally looks like a better solution. (use_gps_velned = 1)

```

**600 Tricopter:**

Home design 600mm tricopter. Same amateur pilot who only ever flies in horizon /LOS.

````
3S, 4200mAh (Graphene), 10x5 HQ Thin Electic props, 1000kv. c. 900grams all up.
iNav 1.4 for the rockin' async_gyro. 
Gets about 18 minutes gentle / nav modes, maybe 16 mins for aggressive manual flying.

F3 (SPEVO). Enjoys the relatively high PIDs.
