Hello and welcome to INAV 2.0.0 Release!

Please carefully read all of this document for the best possibile experience and safety.

## Important Notes

**DO NOT RESTORE ACCELEROMETER CALIBRATION VALUES FROM AN OLDER RELEASE (<2.0)** Doing that will led to poor attitude estimation performance and may cause troubles.

When upgrading a full chip erase (when flashing) / `defaults` from CLI is advised. Be sure to backup your configuration and restore it wisely.

OSD layout configuration from releases < 2.0 is not compatible with the current one. Take a screenshot of your current OSD layout before upgrading and restore it manually from the configurator.

`current_meter_offset` setting changed scale. Need to be multiplied by 10 if it's value is coming from < INAV 2.0.0 

Position Hold 2D (only keeping horizontal position with GPS aid) has been dropped. Now Position Hold is only 3D and it will hold position and altitude.

**STM32F1 boards support has been dropped. NAZE/CC3D targets are no longer supported.** Please upgrade to F4/F7 board. F3 boards are not recommended since their flash space is almost full and they are likely to not receive all features on the next release.

## Upgrading from 1.9.X

1. Be sure to run the latest INAV 2.0 Configuration release. Download from [here]
2. Go to the CLI tab and copy and paste the `diff` output to a text file for later usage. 
3. Go to the OSD tab and take a screenshot of the current layout
4. Flash INAV 2.0 enabling **full chip erase** . Now you FC should run INAV 2.0. Connect again and check firmware version.
5. Go to the Mixer tab and load and apply your desidered mixer.
6. Go back to your configuration text file and delete all lines starting with: mixer acczero accgain magzero osd. Adjust values to be adjusted noted in the release notes.
7. Open the CLI tab in the configurator and paste your cleaned up configuration in the text box and type `save` and press enter. The flight controller will now reboot.
8. Calibrate the accelerometer following the steps in the dedicated tab. Only first two steps needs to be made in the right order.
9. Calibration of the magnetometer should be done at the field. The magnetic field indoors can be distorted and led to a bad calibration.
10. Restore manually your OSD layout using the screenshot and upload the font you like using the dedicated button.
11. Carefully check all the configuration and check on the bench without installed propellers if everything looks good. In particular check if the model preview behave correctly when you are moving your model and check surfaces movements for an airplane.
12. Enjoy INAV 2.0.0 and explore its new features!

## Walk through if TL;DR

## Known bugs

* none yet

## New mixer and mixer GUI

Starting from INAV 2.0.0, there are no predefined mixers on the firmware side: CLI command `mixer QUADX` will just not work. Mixer has to be configured using INAV Configurator 2.0 with __Mixer__ tab.

Restoring from previous releases via CLI will not work correctly. Please use _Configurator 2.0_ mixer tab to configure it from scratch.

See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cLFu-5syi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cLFu-5syi0) 

It is no longer necessary to use `smix reverse` to reverse a tricopter tail servo; this can be done in the 2.0 Configurator or with the CLI `smix 0 5 2 -100 0`.


## Added `NAV CRUISE` flight mode (fixed wing)

This release introduces the new `NAV CRUISE` flight mode. When enabled the machine will try to maintain the current heading and compensate for any external disturbances (2D CRUISE). User can adjust the flight direction directly with ROLL stick or with the YAW stick ( `nav_fw_cruise_yaw_rate` set the yawing rate at full stick deflection ). The latter will offer a smoother way to adjust the flight direction. If the mode is enabled in conjunction with `NAV ALTHOLD` also the current altitude will be maintained (3D CRUISE). Altitude can be adjusted, as usual, via the pitch stick. In both modes `ANGLE` mode is active and the plane will stay leveled.

## OSD improvements

OSD functionally got overhauled and improved. Now it is possible to have three OSD layouts and switch between them via an RC channel. Furthermore new two modes have been added: `map` and `radar`.

* `map` mode draws the home centered, while the craft moves around. There are two available maps: one with the North pointing up and another one with the takeoff direction pointing up.
* `radar` mode draws the craft in the center and the home moving around.

Those modes will enable the display of other aircraft flying in the vicinity in a future releases.

It is now possible to display a lot of new data on the OSD:
- All the values adjustable in flight via RC. When a value is selected for adjustment it starts blinking. This means it is possible to select a lot of adjustments with a pot for example and know easily which one is being adjusted.
- Wind estimation
- Numeric attitude angles
- Cruise mode heading info
- Numeric heading to home
- New battery related data: estimated remaining time and distance before having to head home, sag compensated battery voltage, estimated battery impedance
- Outputs of the PID controllers

## Added full VTX control via Smart Audio / TRAMP

User can now select VTX settings from the configurator or via the OSD CMS. Furthermore `vtx_low_power_disarm` setting has been added. Setting it to `ON` will set the power to its minimum value on startup (usually 25mW) and increase it to `vtx_power` when arming and change it back to its lowest setting after disarming. Note that this setting can jeopardize the ability to find a lost quad using a strong signal coming from the VTX but on the other way it can prevent the VTX to overheat if you do quick flight cycles on the same battery.
 `UNTIL_FIRST_ARM` will set the VTX to its minimum power, but once the craft is armed it will increase the output power to `vtx_power` and it will never decrease until the craft is power cycled. `OFF` will make the power output always to be set to the `vtx_power` setting.

## Wind Estimation for Fixed Wing 

It is possible to show estimated wind speed and direction on the OSD. In particular both lateral and vertical indicators are present. This is an experimental feature, you are encouraged to use it and report any anomalies in the estimated wind speed.

## Battery management related features

These features have been added for helping with the battery management:
- Battery profile with optional automatic switching
- Sag compensated battery voltage and battery impedance calculation
- Estimation of the remaining flight time and distance before having to head home
- Automatic compensation of throttle command based on battery voltage to help maintain constant thrust regardless of the battery voltage
- The current sensor can be calibrated more accurately (increased offset voltage resolution: 0.1mV instead of 1mV). If you'd like to keep your `current_meter_offset` value from an old config you need to multiply it by 10).

You can read more about these feature in the [battery documentation](/iNavFlight/inav/blob/development/docs/Battery.md)

## Developer Notes

Due to a beneficial change in the build environment (generated files are stored per target, not in a common area), it is necessary to remove a couple of files from any older branches (these files are generated automatically by the build).
