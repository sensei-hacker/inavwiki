## WARNINGS

**DO NOT RESTORE ACCELEROMETER CALIBRATION VALUES FROM AN OLDER RELEASE (<2.0)** Doing that will led to poor attitude estimation performance and may cause troubles.

When upgrading a full chip erase (when flashing) / `defaults` from CLI is advised. Be sure to backup your configuration and restore it wisely.

OSD layout configuration from releases < 2.0 is not compatible with the current one. Take a screenshot of your current OSD layout before upgrading and restore it manually from the configurator.

**STM32F1 boards support has been dropped. NAZE/CC3D targets are no more supported.** Please upgrade to F4/F7 board.

## Known bugs

* none yet

## New mixer and mixer GUI

Starting from INAV 2.0.0, there are no predefined mixers on the firmware side: CLI command `mixer QUADX` will just not work. Mixer has to be configured using INAV Configurator 2.0 with __Mixer__ tab.

Restoring from previous releases via CLI will not work correctly. Please use _Configurator 2.0_ mixer tab to configure it from scratch.

## Added `NAV CRUISE` flight mode (fixed wing)

This release introduces the new `NAV CRUISE` flight mode. When enabled the machine will try to maintain the current heading and compensate for any external disturbances (2D CRUISE). User can adjust the flight direction directly with ROLL stick or with the YAW stick ( `nav_fw_cruise_yaw_rate` set the yawing rate at full stick deflection ). The latter will offer a smoother way to adjust the flight direction. If the mode is enabled in conjunction with `NAV ALTHOLD` also the current altitude will be maintained (3D CRUISE). Altitude can be adjusted, as usual, via the pitch stick.

## OSD improvements

OSD functionally got overhauled and improved. Now it is possible to have three OSD layouts and switch between them via an RC channel. Furthermore new two modes have been added: `map` and `radar`.

* `map` mode draws the home centered, while the craft moves around. There are two available maps: one with the North pointing up and another one with the takeoff direction pointing up.
* `radar` mode draws the craft in the center and the home moving around.

Those modes will enable to display other aircrafts flying in the vicinity on future releases.

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

| Name               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nav_fw_cruise_yaw_rate` |  Max YAW rate when NAV CRUISE mode is enabled (0=disable control via yaw stick) [dps] |
| `gyro_stage2_lowpass_hz`	| Software based second stage lowpass filter for gyro. Value is cutoff frequency (Hz). Currently experimental
