## WARNINGS

**DO NOT RESTORE ACCELEROMETER CALIBRATION VALUES FROM AN OLDER RELEASE (<2.0)**

Doing that will led to poor attitude estimation performance and may cause troubles.

## Known bugs

## Added `NAV CRUISE` flight mode (fixed wing)

This release introduces the new `NAV CRUISE` flight mode. When enabled the machine will try to maintain the current heading and compensate for any external disturbances (2D CRUISE). User can adjust the flight direction directly with ROLL stick or with the YAW stick ( `nav_fw_cruise_yaw_rate` set the yawing rate at full stick deflection ). The latter will offer a smoother way to adjust the flight direction. If the mode is enabled in conjunction with `NAV ALTHOLD` also the current altitude will be maintained (3D CRUISE). Altitude can be adjusted, as usual, via the pitch stick.

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

| Name               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nav_fw_cruise_yaw_rate` |  Max YAW rate when NAV CRUISE mode is enabled (0=disable control via yaw stick) [dps] |

### New mixer GUI

Starting from INAV 2.0.0, there are no predefined mixers on the firmware side: CLI command `mixer QUADX` will just not work. Mixer has to be configured using INAV Configurator 2.0 with __Mixer__ tab.

Restoring from previous releases via CLI will not work correctly. Please use _Configurator 2.0_ mixer tab to configure it from scratch.
