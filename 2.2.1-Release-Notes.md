## Important Notes

1. Arming with sticks is being removed since it is not safe to use. You must use a switch to ARM.
2. Using feature `MOTOR STOP` on multi rotors is not advised and it is not considered safe by the developers, it's there due the demand from users.

## Upgrading from 2.1.0

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 2.2.1 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously create and write _save_ , press ENTER and done!
5. If you armed with via sticks, add an arming switch in the Modes tab in the configurator.
6. If you are upgrading a multi rotor, POS XY PID I and D have now specific settings, respectively `nav_mc_pos_deceleration_time` and `nav_mc_pos_expo` . So if you don't use defaults, when restoring, move yours to the new settings.
7. You should be ready, explore new 2.2.1 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.0.0

0. Please follow the upgrade guide to 2.1.0 and then step to the previous section.

## CLI:

### New

| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `acc_lpf_type ` | Specifies the type of the software LPF of the acc signals. BIQUAD gives better filtering and more delay, PT1 less filtering and less delay, so use only on clean builds. |
| `nav_mc_pos_deceleration_time` | Used for stoping distance calculation. Stop position is computed as _speed_ * _nav_mc_pos_deceleration_time_ from the place where sticks are released. Braking mode overrides this setting |
| `nav_mc_pos_expo` | Expo for PosHold control |
| `use_dterm_fir_filter`| Setting to **OFF** disabled extra filter on Dterm. **OFF** offers faster Dterm and better inflight performance with a cost of being more sensitive to gyro noise. Small and relatively clean multirotors (7 inches and below) are suggested to use **OFF** setting. If motors are getting too hot, switch back to **ON** |
|  `osd_gforce_alarm`     | Value above which the OSD g force indicator will blink (g) |
|  `osd_gforce_axis_alarm_min` | Value under which the OSD axis g force indicators will blink (g) |
|  `osd_gforce_axis_alarm_max`  | Value above which the OSD axis g force indicators will blink (g) |
| mc_airmode_type | Defines the Airmode state handling type for Multirotors. Default **STICK_CENTER** is the classical approach in which Airmode is always active if enabled, but when the throttle is low and ROLL/PITCH/YAW sticks are centered, Iterms is not allowed to grow (ANTI_WINDUP). **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** is the Airmode behavior known from Betaflight. In this mode, Airmode is active as soon THROTTLE position is above `mc_airmode_threshold` and stays active until disarm. ANTI_WINDUP is never triggered. For small Multirotors (up to 7-inch propellers) it is suggested to switch to **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** since it keeps full stabilization no matter what pilot does with the sticks. Fixed Wings always use **STICK_CENTER** mode. | 
| `mc_airmode_threshold` | Defines airmode THROTTLE activation threshold when `mc_airmode_type` **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** is used | 
|  `osd_current_alarm` | Value above which the OSD current consumption element will start blinking. Measured in full Amperes. |
| `sim_ground_station_number` | Number of phone that is used to communicate with SIM module. Messages / calls from other numbers are ignored. If undefined, can be set by calling or sending a message to the module. |
| `sim_transmit_interval` | Text message transmission interval in seconds for SIM module. Minimum value: 10 |
| `sim_transmit_flags` | String specifying text message transmit condition flags for the SIM module. Flags can be given in any order. Empty string means the module only sends response messages. `A`: acceleration events, `T`: continuous transmission, `F`: continuous transmission in failsafe mode, `L`: continuous transmission when altitude is below `sim_low_altitude`, `G`: continuous transmission when GPS signal quality is low |
| `acc_event_threshold_high` | Acceleration threshold [cm/s/s] for impact / high g event text messages sent by SIM module. Acceleration values greater than 4 g can occur in fixed wing flight without an impact, so a setting of 4000 or greater is suggested. 0 = detection off. |
| `acc_event_threshold_low` | Acceleration threshold [cm/s/s] for low-g / freefall detection text messages sent by SIM module. A setting of less than 100 is suggested. Valid values: [0-900], 0 = detection off. |
| `acc_event_threshold_neg_x` | Acceleration threshold [cm/s/s] for backwards acceleration / fixed wing landing detection text messages sent by SIM module. Suggested value for fixed wing: 1100. 0 = detection off. |
| `sim_low_altitude` | Threshold for low altitude warning messages sent by SIM module when the 'L' transmit flag is set in `sim_transmit_flags`.|
|  `failsafe_mission` | If set to `OFF` the failsafe procedure won't be triggered and the mission will continue if the FC is in WP (automatic mission) mode |
### Removed


| Setting | Description |
| ----    | ------ |
| `auto_disarm_delay ` | |

## STM32F7 optimizations

INAV 2.2 offers a huge performance boost for all F7 based flight controllers (STM32F745 and STM32F722). Thanks to using both fast _Instruction_ and _Data_ memory (**ITCM** and **DTCM**), INAV on F7 boards is as fast as on F4 boards. Special thanks to @diehertz for helping and original work for Betaflight. With performance fixes, INAV 2.2 is now capable of running 8kHz PID loop. 

> It is still not advised to use 8kHz when any I2C devices are connected to flight controller (**BOTH F4 and F7**). This specially applies to **Magnetometer** and **Barometer**. Because I2C bus driver is synchronous and the process or reading data for MAG or BARO takes longer than time available between PID loop cycles, jitter will appear. 

If **I2C** magnetometer or barometer are to be used, switch to 4kHz mode!

## Logic Conditions

**Logic conditions** is a new function framework that in INAV 2.2 allows to activate and deactivate specific servo mixer rules.

Logic conditions can evaluate RC channels, flight parameters, and other logic conditions into true/false and activate/deactivate servo mixer rules. It opens possibilities like:
* automatically deploy flaps when speed is too low
* activate servo when distance or altitude has been reached
* flaps/spoilers with different throws

Future versions of INAV will allow using **Logic conditions** to switch motor mixer banks and make other overrides that currently cannot be changed during flight or be activated by flight conditions 

## Optic flow calibration

Finally for the machines equipped with optic flow we have a calibration logic. After pressing the button in the Configurator you have 30 seconds to hold the copter in the air and tilt it to sides without moving it horizontally. The calibration code inside the flight controller will calculate the `opflow_scale` variable automatically.

## Accelerometer vibration mitigation

The altitude/position estimation code is now aware of high accelerometer vibration making INAV to counteract the uncontrolled climb in navigation modes [#486]. There is no OSD indication of excessive vibration yet.

WARNING: This is an emergency mode of operation. The uncontrolled climb is caused by accelerometer clipping when vibration exceeds the range accelerometer is capable of measuring. This effect is induced by vibration (usually high frequency) and can't be fully compensated by software filtering so you should soft-mount your FC to minimize the risk of this happening.

## Cellular telemetry via text messages

INAV 2.2 can use a SimCom SIM800 series cellular module to provide telemetry via text messages. Telemetry messages can be requested by calling the module's number or sending it a text message. The module can be set to transmit messages at regular intervals, or when an acceleration event is detected. A text message command can be used to put the flight controller into RTH mode.
Modules like [this](https://inavflight.com/shop/s/bg/1062819) one should work flawlessly.


## Support for INAV Radar 

INAV 2.2 introduces the support for Radar ESP32 boards. They can be used to share information (including position) between multiple machines. This enables, for instance, the possibility to display the positions live on the OSD.
More infos can be found in the dedicated wiki page here: [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/OSD-Hud-and-ESP32-radars)
