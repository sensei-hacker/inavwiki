## Important Notes

**Compass has to be recalibrated**. Do not import from previous INAV releases

**Do not migrate Multirotor PID and filter settings** from previous releases of INAV. Use Multirotor default preset (3"-7") instead and make required changes on top of that

### F3 Deprecation

STM32 F3 flight controllers like Omnibus F3 or SP Racing F3 are deprecated and soon they will reach the end of support in INAV. If you are still using F3 boards, please migrate to F4 or F7.

## Safehome replaces RTH offset distance and direction

A new feature `safehome` (see [below](#safehome-tonyyng)) replaces `nav_rth_home_offset_distance` and `nav_rth_home_offset_direction`, offering a safer and much more flexible function. If you were using the `nav_rth_home_offset_*` settings, please migrate to `safehome`as these settings are removed.

## Upgrading from 2.5

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 2.5 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go the CLI again and paste the contents on the file you previously create and write _save_ , press ENTER and done!
5. You should be ready, explore new 2.6 features and enjoy!

## Upgrading from 2.4 or older version

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.
 
## New targets:

* IFLIGHTF4_SUCCEXD ([@digitalentity])

## CLI:

### New commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
|  `safehome` | List of home locations, see [Safehomes.md](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Safehomes.md) and [summary](#safehome-tonyyng)  |

### Changed Settings

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `mag_hardware` | New option added `MSP`|
| `baro_hardware` | New options added `DPS310` and `MSP` |
| `pitot_hardware` | New options added `MSP`|
| `serialrx_provider` | New options added `FPORT2` and `SRXL2` |
| `gps_provider` | New options added `MSP` |
| `debug_mode` | New options added `CD`, `KALMAN_GAIN`, `PID_MEASUREMENT`, `SPM_CELLS`, `SPM_VS600`, `SPM_VARIO`, `PCF8574` |
| `airmode_type` | New option added `STICK_CENTER_ONCE` |
| `nav_overrides_motor_stop` | Modified values `OFF`, `AUTO_ONLY`, `ALL_NAV`. When set OFF the navigation system will not take over the control of the motor if the throttle is low (motor will stop). When set to AUTO_ONLY the navigation system will only take over the control of the throttle in autonomous navigation modes (NAV WP and NAV RTH). When set to ALL_NAV (default) the navigation system will take over the control of the motor completely and never allow the motor to stop even when the throttle is low. This setting only has an effect combined with MOTOR_STOP and is likely to cause a stall if `fw_min_throttle_down_pitch` isn't set correctly or the pitch estimation is wrong for fixed wing models when not set to ALL_NAV.  |

## New drivers and protocols

* DPS310 barometer ([@digitalentity])

## New waypoint types support: SET_HEAD and SET_POI ([@stronnag])

The `SET_POI` WP type defines a location for a point of interest (POI). The craft will fly the mission (until a SET_HEAD) with the nose pointing at the POI, which might be useful for aerial photography. Note that the craft does NOT fly to the POI. [Wiki description and example](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-Navigation-Messages#set-poi-multirotor-only-multiwii-inav-26-and-later).

The `SET_HEAD` type sets the craft's heading (where it 'looks', not the direction of travel). This may be useful for useful for aerial photography. A value of `-1` causing the heading to be 'straight ahead', i.e. the direction of travel. Thus, `SET_POI` `-1` may used to cancel a previous valid `SET_HEAD` or `SET_POI`. A `SET_HEAD` remains in force until cancelled by `SET_HEAD` with `p1` of `-1`, or modified by a subsequent `SET_HEAD` or `SET_POI`. [Wiki description and example](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/MSP-Navigation-Messages#set_head-multirotor-only-multiwii-inav-26-and-later).

For now, this new waypoint types works only for multirotors, as this type of aircraft can fly "looking" to a different direction than it's flying. Different of an airplane, which can only fly forward and thus can only look forward when flying.

## Safehome ([@tonyyng])

Safehome replaces the `nav_rth_home_offset_*` settings, and allows the pilot to define up to 8 alternative home locations as absolute positions (lat, lon as decimal degress * 10,000,000). If a `safehome` is within 200m of the arming point, it will be used as the home location for RTH etc. Please see the separate document [Safehomes.md](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Safehomes.md).

## Improvements to RTH/WP handling ([@digitalentity]).

WP mode activation with no mission loaded previously kept the current flight mode which may be counter-intuitive to the pilot. OSD will show that the mode is kept, however WP missions are generally not FPV. This PR creates a fallback in such case and will execute RTH instead which is safer than let the drone drift away. Also fixes a bug when RTH procedure may get interrupted in case of a brief sensor loss and switch out to ANGLE, ACRO or MANUAL instead of EMERGENCY. On airplanes with a certain RTH settings a brief GPS loss is tolerated in the navigation state machine, while the RTH activation bug would still bail out. This PR fixes this by making RTH procedure sticky, similar to other navigation flight modes.

## cmake Development environment ([@fiam])

inav 2.6 updates the build environment to use `cmake` as the build management tool. The developer build documentation has been updated for all platforms (MacOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD). Please see the [platform specific documentation](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/tree/master/docs/development).

## Small improvements

* **New Azimuth OSD element** ([@danarrib]) - Shows the direction of the aircraft from home. It's useful to keep the aircraft flying on the correct path in front of a high gain directional antenna.
* **Automatic CLI documentation** ([@nmaggioni]) - Now the [CLI.md](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Cli.md) document is auto-generated based on actual source code. It means that now this documentation is much more accurate and always updated.
* **Removed "AIR" flight mode on the OSD** ([@MrD-RC]) - Airmode is not a flight mode itself, it's just ACRO.
