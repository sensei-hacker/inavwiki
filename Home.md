iNAV is a fork of cleanflight with a heavy focus upon GPS features for both airplanes & multirotor models.

iNav is **being actively developed** and currently supports RTH (_Return To Home_) with a predefined climb height, position hold, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]], "follow-me" and many more features. 

A wide variety of inexpensive flight controller boards are supported.  F4 & F7 flight control boards are **strongly suggested** to gain access to the full features of iNav.

Latest release for F1 boards is INAV 1.7.3

iNav has many settings that are different than cleanflight, so while the configurator may look familiar to you, simply restoring settings from an older version of cleanflight won't work & the calibration process is very, very different.

**As such it is ABSOLUTELY mandatory to read these pages:**
