INAV is **being actively developed** and currently supports RTH (_Return To Home_) with a predefined climb height, position hold, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]], "follow-me" and many more features.

A wide variety of inexpensive flight controller boards are supported.  F4 & F7 flight control boards are **strongly suggested** to gain access to the full features of INAV.
