INAV is a Free and Open Source Flight Controller and Autopilot Software System that is **being actively developed** with a [couple of new feature releases each year](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/).

- It is compatible with large quantity of inexpensive flight controller boards (FC) and sensors built specificly for INAV and use in RC vehicles. Specifically F4 & F7 flight control (FC) boards are **strongly suggested** to gain access to the full features of INAV.
- It can control a variety of flying vehicles (airplanes, gliders, multi-rotors, quadcopters), ground vehicles (cars, tanks), and water vehicles (boats).
- It includes auto navigation modes like [[RTH (_return to home_)|Navigation-Mode:-Return-to-Home]], position hold, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]], "follow-me", and many more features.
