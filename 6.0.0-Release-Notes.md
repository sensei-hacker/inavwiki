# Important Notes


# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 5 and 5.1

0. Download and install the new [configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
1. Save to a file the current _diff all_ from the CLI.
2. Upgrade to INAV 6 using the Full Erase option in the configurator.
3. Upload your OSD font of choice from the OSD tab.
4. Go to the CLI again and paste the above-described contents from the file you previously created and write _save_ , press ENTER.
5. There are a large number of new, changed, and removed settings. Check carefully that the settings are correct and fix any unrecognized or out-of-range items from the saved configuration.
6. You should be ready, explore new 5.0 features, and enjoy!

## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

# Important changes

## **New AHRS (Attitude & Heading Reference System)**
-----------------------------
INAV 6.0 includes a complete rework of the AHRS for Attitude Estimation, to make sure INAV always knows it's correct attitude relative to the ground. This should once and for all fix the issue, known as "Horizon Drift" and makes any navigation mode as well as self-leveling modes like ANGLE fully reliable and allows much more precise GPS-Navigation. This affects Fixed Wing as well as Multirotor. 

The best results are given if the craft is equipped with GPS and in the case of Multirotor also with a compass. But also for pure LOS Crafts that have no GPS on board, the AHI stability is noticeably improved in most situations. To work best with non-GPS Fixed Wings, the Reference Airspeed has to be set according the average cruise speed of the craft. 

---------------------------
### Beta only: When Updating from INAV 5.1 or older, apply the following settings after loading back your previous DIFF (Any Fixed Wing or Copter): 

set imu_acc_ignore_rate = 15
set imu_acc_ignore_slope = 10
set imu_dcm_kp = 2000
set imu_dcm_ki = 50
set imu_dcm_kp_mag = 2000
set imu_dcm_ki_mag = 50

**For Fixed Wing Craft with no GPS:** 
set fw_reference_airspeed = _(set this in cm/s. Set this to airspeed at which PIDs were tuned. Usually should be set to cruise airspeed. Also used for coordinated turn calculation if airspeed sensor is not present.)_

If you notice any problems, please head to the Discussion Thread here and post your feedback, if possible with DVR and Blackbox log: https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/discussions/8469

## HUD Offset change
The operation of `osd_horizon_offset` has been reversed, to make it more intuitive. If you have a non-zero value for `osd_horizon_offset` it will need to be inverted. For example `osd_horizon_offset = 1` would become `osd_horizon_offset = -1`. Positive values move the HUD up, and negative values move it down.

# New targets

# CLI

## Changed settings
`nav_extra_arming_safety` The `OFF` option has been removed. `ON` and `ALLOW_BYPASS` are now the only valid options.
